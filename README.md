# Bike-Rental-Prediction-with-R
Problem Statement:

In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. Hence, a bike rental company wants to understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the environment and seasons.

Objective: The objective of this case is to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm.
Steps to Perform: 

1.    Exploratory data analysis
•    Load dataset and libraries
•    Perform data type conversion of the attributes
•    Carry out the missing value analysis
2. Attributes distributions and trends
•    Plot monthly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
•    Plot yearly distribution of the total number of bikes rented
•    Plot boxplot for outliers analysis
3. Split the dataset into train and test dataset
4. Create a model using the random forest algorithm
5. Predict the performance of the model on the test dataset
